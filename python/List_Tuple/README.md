## What is a List
- A `list` is an ordered collection of items. </br>
- Python uses the square brackets ([]) to indicate a `list`. The following shows an `empty list`: </br>

```python
empty_list = []
```
- When we create a List object, it takes 56 bytes of memory. </br>
- [List Overall](./list.py) </br>
- [List CRUD](./CRUD_list.py) </br>
- [List Sort](./sort_list.py) </br>
    - The `sort()` method sorts a list in place. In other words, it changes the order of elements in the original list. </br>
    - To return the new sorted list from the original list, you use the `sorted()` function

## What is Tuple?
- Sometimes, you want to create a list of items that cannot be changed throughout the program. `Tuples` allow you to do that. </br>
- A `tuple` is a list that cannot change (immutable list). Python refers to a value that cannot change as immutable. So by definition, a `tuple` is an `immutable list`. </br>
